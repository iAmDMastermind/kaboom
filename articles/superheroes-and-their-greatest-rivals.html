        <h1>10 superheroes and their greatest rivals</h1>
        <img class="content-image" src="../assets/content/supes.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Superhero stories have fascinated readers for many years.
            What makes these tales so exciting isn’t just the heroes, but also the powerful enemies they fight.
            These battles between good and evil often shape who the heroes are and create some of the most unforgettable
            moments
            in comic books.
            Below, we explore 10 famous superheroes and their toughest enemies.
        </p>

        <p>Without villains, superheroes wouldn’t have a purpose. Villains challenge heroes, forcing them to prove their
            courage, strength, and determination.
            It’s through their battles with villains that heroes show what they’re truly made of.
            In many ways, a hero is only as great as the challenges they overcome, and those challenges often come in
            the form
            of powerful, cunning, and relentless enemies.
            These adversaries bring out the best in heroes, making their stories more thrilling and their victories more
            meaningful. Without villains, superheroes wouldn’t have the chance to rise to the occasion and save the day.
        </p>

        <h1>10. Thor vs Loki</h1>
        <img class="content-image" src="../articles/content/Thor-vs-Loki-fight.png" alt="" width="50%">
        <h2>The God of Thunder and the Trickster God</h2>
        <p>
            Thor’s most enduring rival is his brother Loki, the God of Mischief. Their rivalry is complex, rooted in
            family
            dynamics, jealousy, and a constant struggle for power. Loki’s cunning and trickery contrast sharply with
            Thor’s
            strength and honor, making their battles as much about wit as they are about might.
            Despite their antagonism, there is an underlying bond between them, which adds depth to their relationship.
        </p>

        <h1>9. Wonder woman vs ares</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/ww.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>the amazon warrior and the god of war</h2>
        <p>
            Wonder Woman’s greatest enemy is Ares, the God of War.
            Their rivalry is mythological, representing the eternal battle between peace and war.
            Ares thrives on conflict and destruction, making him a natural adversary for Wonder Woman, who seeks to
            bring peace to the world.
            Their battles are epic, often involving the fate of the world
        </p>

        <h1>8. Wolverine vs Sabertooth</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/wolverine.jpeg" width="280px" class="content-image">
        <h2>The animalistic battle of savage beasts</h2>
        <p>Wolverine and his brother Sabretooth have a savage, primal rivalry that dates back decades.
            Both characters possess heightened senses, healing factors, and a shared, mysterious past. Sabretooth’s
            sadistic nature and deep-seated hatred for Wolverine make their confrontations brutal and bloody.
            Their battles are often personal, fueled by a mix of hatred, rivalry, and a shared history of pain and
            suffering.
        </p>

        <h1>7. Batman vs. The Joker</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/batty.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>The Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of Crime</h2>
        <p>Batman’s ongoing struggle with the Joker is one of the most complex and iconic rivalries in comic book
            history.
            Batman represents order, control, and justice, while the Joker embodies chaos, anarchy, and madness. Their
            battles are not just physical; they are psychological, with each character pushing the other to their
            limits.
            The Joker’s unpredictable nature makes him Batman’s most dangerous foe, constantly challenging the Dark
            Knight’s moral code.
        </p>

        <h1>6. Captain America vs. Red Skull</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/cap.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>The Sentinel of Liberty and the Face of Evil</h2>
        <p>Captain America’s battles with the Red Skull are deeply rooted in World War II.
            The Red Skull, a Nazi officer turned terrorist mastermind, represents the antithesis of everything Captain
            America stands for.
            Their rivalry is not just a physical confrontation but a symbolic struggle between freedom and tyranny, hope
            and despair.
        </p>

        <h1>5. The Flash vs. Reverse-Flash</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/flash.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>The Fastest Man Alive and His Dark Reflection</h2>
        <p>The Flash’s greatest rival is the Reverse-Flash, a villain from the future who has made it his mission to
            destroy everything Barry Allen (The Flash) holds dear.
            Reverse-Flash, also known as Eobard Thawne, has the same speed powers as the Flash, but uses them for evil.
            Their battles often involve complex time-travel elements, making their rivalry one of the most intricate in
            the superhero genre.
        </p>

        <h1>4. Spider-Man vs. Green Goblin</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/spidey.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>The Web-Slinger and the Mad Industrialist</h2>
        <p>Spider-Man’s rivalry with the Green Goblin is deeply personal. Norman Osborn, the man behind the Goblin mask,
            is not just a supervillain—he is the father of Peter Parker’s best friend.
            This adds a layer of tragedy to their conflict.
            The Green Goblin’s brutal attacks, including the death of Gwen Stacy, have caused immense suffering for
            Spider-Man, making him one of the hero’s most hated enemies.
        </p>

        <h1>3. Green Lantern vs. Sinestro</h1>
        <img src="../articles/content/green.jpeg" alt="" class="content-image">
        <h2>
            <The Emerald Knight and the Fallen Mentor/h2>
                <p>Green Lantern’s greatest rival is Sinestro, a former Green Lantern who was once Hal Jordan’s mentor.
                    Sinestro’s fall from grace, his embrace of fear over willpower, and his creation of the Sinestro
                    Corps have made him a powerful and dangerous adversary. Their battles often explore themes of fear,
                    control, and the nature of true heroism.</p>

                <h1>2. Iron Man vs. The Mandarin</h1>
                <img src="../articles/content/ironman.jpg" alt="" class="content-image">
                <h2>The Armored Avenger and the Master of the Ten Rings</h2>
                <p>Iron Man’s most dangerous rival is the Mandarin, a villain who combines mysticism with advanced
                    technology. The Mandarin’s ten rings, each with a unique power, make him a formidable foe. His
                    desire to conquer the world and destroy Tony Stark’s legacy creates a deadly rivalry that challenges
                    Iron Man on both a physical and intellectual level.</p>

                <h1>1. Superman vs. Lex Luthor</h1>
                <img src="../articles/content/superman.jpg" alt="" class="content-image">
                <h2>The Man of Steel and lex luthor</h2>
                <p>Superman, the embodiment of hope and justice, faces off against Lex Luthor, a genius billionaire with
                    a deep hatred for the Kryptonian hero. Luthor's enmity stems from a mix of jealousy, fear, and
                    ideological differences. He sees Superman as a threat to humanity’s independence, often using his
                    vast resources and intellect to devise plans to destroy or discredit the hero. This rivalry
                    showcases the classic battle between power and intellect.</p>
